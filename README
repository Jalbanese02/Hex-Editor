A hex editor I made in gymnasium for a university course teaching python and basic programming.
The hex editor uses tkinter, so on arch based distributions you can:
  sudo pacman -S tk
  chmod u+x GHE.py
  
and it should run.

The hex editor can display raw hex data as well as an ascii representation of that data.
You can also edit data in files and thus patch binaries in your liking.
